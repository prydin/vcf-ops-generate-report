# VCF Operations Report Runner

Runs a report in VCF Operations and writes the result to a file or standard out. This is useful for exporting 
data from VCF Operations using the command line or scheduled jobs.

The command takes a report name and the resource kind and name of a top level resource (e.g. a Datacenter) and run
a report with that resource as a parent object (e.g. processes all clusters under Datacenter)

python generate_report.py [-h] -H HOST -u USER -p PASSWORD [-a AUTHSOURCE] [-k ADAPTERKIND] -r RESOURCEKIND -n RESOURCENAME -R REPORTNAME [-o OUTPUTFILE] [-U]
